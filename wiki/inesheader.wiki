||0-3||      String "NES^Z" used to recognize .NES files.||
||4||        Number of 16kB ROM banks.||
||5||        Number of 8kB VROM banks.||
||6||        bit 0 1 for vertical mirroring, 0 for horizontal mirroring. <br />bit 1 1 for battery-backed RAM at $6000-$7FFF.<br />bit 2 1 for a 512-byte trainer at $7000-$71FF.<br />bit 3 1 for a four-screen VRAM layout.<br />bit 4-7 Four lower bits of ROM Mapper Type.<br />||
||7||        bit 0     1 for VS-System cartridges. bit 1-3   Reserved, must be zeroes! bit 4-7   Four higher bits of ROM Mapper Type.||
||8||        Number of 8kB RAM banks. For compatibility with the previous versions of the .NES format, assume 1x8kB RAM page when this byte is zero.||
||9||        bit 0     1 for PAL cartridges, otherwise assume NTSC. bit 1-7   Reserved, must be zeroes!||
||10-15||    Reserved, must be zeroes!||
||16-...||   ROM banks, in ascending order. If a trainer is present, its 512 bytes precede the ROM bank contents.||
||...-EOF||  VROM banks, in ascending order.||
